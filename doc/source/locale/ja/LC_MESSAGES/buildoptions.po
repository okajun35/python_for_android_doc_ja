#: ../../source/buildoptions.rst:38
msgid "This uses the prebuilt Python from the `CrystaX NDK <https://www.crystax.net/android/ndk>`__, a drop-in replacement for Google's official NDK which includes many improvements. You *must* use the CrystaX NDK 10.3.0 or higher when building with python3. You can get it `here <https://www.crystax.net/en/download>`__."

#: ../../source/buildoptions.rst:75
msgid "From the point of view of a Python program, SDL2 should behave as normal. For instance, you can build apps with Kivy or PySDL2 and have them work with this bootstrap. It should also be possible to use e.g. pygame_sdl2, but this would need a build recipe and doesn't yet have one."
